        This however requires technical skills and lots of patience.
        <br>

        <br><br>
        First, I suggest to do your own research (DYOR).<br>
        Second, understand how the mining app works before coming up to that conclusion.
        <br><br>
        Mining pools have their own <b>payment amount threshold</b> and a <b>payment schedule</b>. Some pay once a day. Some pay 4x a day like the <b>verus pool</b> (https://pool.verus.io).
        <br><br>
        The <b>payment amount threshold</b> determines <b>how much balance you need to accumulate</b> before the mining pool pays you on the <b>payment schedule</b>.
        <br><br>
        Once paid, the balance will go to the <b>paid balance</b> and will eventually reflect to your wallet address. You can also see the paid balance from the app in the <b>WALLET BALANCE</b> section.
        <br>
        <br>
        <center><img src="${appImages.minerBaseScreen}" alt="Miner base screen" style="width:350px;height:800px;"></center>
        <br><br>
        <b>Additional Knowledge</b>:
        <br>
        Mining apps are connecting to a mining pool without any special requirements. <b>You don't need to pay anything beforehand to start</b>. Just a capable mining device and a valid wallet address.
        This category of mining is called <b>pool mining.</b>
        <br><br>
        Another type of mining which is called <b>solo mining</b> (or sometimes called <b>node mining</b>) is a mining where not only a capable hardware and a wallet address is needed but also 
        requires you to download the whole blockchain data before you can mine. It's a resource intensive process and tedious to setup as it requires some technical skills.
        <br><br>
        Both help secure the blockchain network and have it's own advantages and disadvantages.
        <br><br>
        This app is doing a <b>pool mining</b>. The easy one.
        <br><br>
        Mining app connects to a mining pool. The mining pool sends challenges to the connected miners (your phone and other mining devices).<br>
        When a miner found a block - the miner solved the challenge sent by the pool, it get's the majority of the block reward.<br>
        The rest goes to the pool operator and the remaining will be distrubuted to all the miners connected during the time the block was found.
        <br><br>
        It will be an <b>immature balance</b> first then once confirmed, will become a <b>balance</b>. Once you got the minimum balance on the schedule set by the pool, it will then be transferred to your wallet.
        <br><br>
        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        immature ðŸ”œ balance ðŸ”œ paid(wallet balance)
        </div>
        <br><br>
        Miners accumulate Verus coins while they are connected to a mining pool. No coin rewards to receive otherwise.<br>Again, confirmed balances are not yet transferred to your wallet address</b>.
        <br><br>`
