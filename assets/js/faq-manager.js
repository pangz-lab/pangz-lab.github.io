            <br>
            Usually phones with Android 7 OS versions or higher. You can just install the app and see if your phone is mineable. Message will show up in the main screen to confirm if your device is mineable or not.

            <b>Follow up question</b> : But why don't you just make a support for 32 bit? device
            <br>
            <b>Answer</b> : No mining software available for that. Majority of the 32 bit phones are not capable of solving the solution required by the Verus Blockchain so there's no use to supporting it.`,

            By default, the app is using the Verus Coin Foundation's wallet address. If your miner found a block while using it, it will go directly to the Verus Coin Foundation when paid which means you can give it away as a support to the community or request to send it back to your own wallet address ( because you realized it was such a careless move ).

            <br>
            Latest phones have virus scanners that treat this mining algorithms as a virus.

        If you really need to run, just lower the cpu to the minimum core/threads. The higher the cpu core/thread, the more phone resource it uses, the higher chance your phone will kill it.

        <br><br>
        One way to work around this is to install a custom ROM that enables the 64 bit instructions.<br>
        This however requires technical skills and lots of patience.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you really are into Verus mining and find the first solution hard but your phone is a throw away, you can probably just sell it or swap from your local marketplace.`

        <br><br>
        First, I suggest to do your own research(DYOR).<br>
        Second, understand how the mining app works before coming up to that conclusion.
        <br>
        <br>
        Mining apps are connecting to a mining pool without any special requirements. <b>You don't need to pay anything to start the mining</b>. Just a capable mining device and a valid wallet address.
        This category of mining is called <b>pool mining.</b>
        <br><br>
        Another type of mining which is called <b>solo mining</b> or sometimes called <b>node mining</b> is a mining where not only you need a capable hardware and a wallet address but also 
        requires you to download the whole blockchain data before you can mine. It's a resource intensive process and a tedious to setup as it requires technical skills.
        <br><br>
        Both help secure the blockchain network and have it's own advantages and disadvantages.
        <br><br>
        This app is doing a <b>pool mining</b>. The easy one.
        <br><br>
        Mining app connects to a mining pool. The mining pool sends challenges to the connected miners( your phone and other mining devices ).<br>
        When a miner found a block - means the miner solved the challenge sent by the pool, it get's the majority of the block reward.<br>
        It will become an <b>immature balance</b> first then once confirmed, will become a <b>balance</b>.
        The rest goes to the pool operator and the remaining will be distrubuted to all the miners connected during the time the block was found.
        <br><br>
        Miners accumulate Verus coins while they are connected to the pool. No coins to receive otherwise.<br>Confirmed balance are not yet transferred to your wallet address</b>.
        <br><br>
        Here is the important part.
        <br><br>
        Mining pools have their own <b>payment amount threshold</b> and a <b>payment schedule</b>. Some pay once a day. Some pay 4x a day like the <b>verus.io</b>.
        <br><br>
        The <b>payment amount threshold</b> determines <b>how much balance you need to accumulate</b> before the mining pool pays you on the recurring <b>payment schedule</b>.
        <br><br>
        Once paid, the balance will go to the <b>paid balance</b> and will eventually reflect to your wallet address. You can also see the paid balance from the app in the <b>WALLET BALANCE</b> section.
